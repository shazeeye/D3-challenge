# D3 Homework - Data Journalism and D3



## Background

I just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper. I'm tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.


The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml]The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

### Creating a repo

1. Created a new repository for this project called `D3-challenge`. 

2. Cloned the new repository to your computer.

3. This homeworks utilized both **html** and **Javascript**. These will be the main files to run for analysis.

5. Pushed the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.



### Core Assignment: D3 Dabbler (Required Assignment)


Created a scatter plot between two the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` and `Smokers vs. Age`.

Used the D3 techniques, created a scatter plot that represented each state with circle elements. Coded this graphic in the `app.js` file of my homework directory— pulled in the data from `data.csv` by using the `d3.csv` function.

* Included state abbreviations in the circles.

* Created and situated axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

* Note: Used `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.

### Bonus: Impress the Boss (Optional Assignment)

#### 1. More Data, More Dynamics

 Placed additional labels in the scatter plot so users can decide which data to display. Animated the transitions for your circles' locations as well as the range of the axes. 



#### 2. Incorporate d3-tip

Added tooltips to the circles and displayed each tooltip with the data that the user has selected.
